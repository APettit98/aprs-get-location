# aprs-get-location
Program that converts a text file containing APRS data into a csv file with just location data

## Usage
Currently uses hard-coded file names, so in order to specify what APRS file to use and what csv file to use, you must edit the code itself. If I ever need to use this again I will likely add filenames as command line arguments.
